Machine Learning Model Usage Sequence

1. EDA
- Check missing values ​​by feature
- Check data type and distribution by feature

2. Data preprocessing
Feature
Normalize data by feature and visualize normal distribution (histogram, QQ-plot)
Remove outliers by feature
If skew is high for continuous data by feature, log transformation is performed
One-hot encoding is performed for categorical data by feature
Analyze correlation between features and visualize heatmap
Check VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) between features to check multi-collinearity (Multi-colinearity)

Target
Normalize target data and visualize normal distribution (histogram, QQ-plot)
Scaling target data (Standarization, Normalizationm, Log)

Feature-Target
Analyze correlation between feature and target and visualize heatmap

3. Feature engineering
Feature Selection
Mainly select features with high correlation with target
Features that can reflect target characteristics Selection(Knowledge-based)
Feature Extraction
Check the explanation variance and explanation variance ratio according to the number of PCA components, then select the number of PCA components (0.8 or higher)

4. Model Training

5. Model Evaluation

6. Check Feature importance
